# Human Resource Management System (HRMS) API

## Introduction

This REST API is designed to provide backend functionality for a Human Resource Management System (HRMS). It is built using Python Django Rest Framework (DRF) and provides endpoints for managing employees, departments, leaves, and other HR-related functionalities.

## Features

- CRUD operations for employees, departments, and roles.
- Authentication and authorization using JWT tokens.
- Custom endpoints for specific HR-related tasks.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/borehelu/HRProject

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
3. Apply database migrations:
      ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
      
4. Create a superuser(for admin access):
      ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
      
5. Start the development server
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver

## Usage

### Authentication
To access protected endpoints, you need to obtain an access token by sending a POST request to the `/api/v1/login` endpoint with your email and password. Two tokens will be returned - access and refresh tokens - in the response, which you should include in the `Authorization` header of subsequent requests as `Bearer <access-token>`.

### Endpoints
